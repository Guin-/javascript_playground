Asynchronous Programming Techniques In Node

Models for managing response logic:

Callbacks
- define logic for one off responses

Event Listeners
- callbacks that are associated with a conceptual entity(event).
- ex: TCP socket. Data event is triggered whenever new data is available on the socket.
  socket.on('data', handleData);
